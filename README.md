# MarsLink_Final_OCSample
This is an Objective-C and Swift 5 version of the official **IGListKit** tutorial.

The current version is a draft and may contain some issues. Developers who are interested in IGListKit are welcome to **open issues** or **fork** the project for further improvement.

A Swift 5 version has been added to replace the original Swift 3 example from the earlier tutorial. Many APIs have been deprecated or changed since then, so this version was rewritten using modern Swift 5 syntax. You can now compare the Objective-C and Swift implementations side by side.
